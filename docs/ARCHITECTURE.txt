Editor:

not happy with overall architecture, encapsulation sucks
want better MVC separation

What is our model? Lots of small models floating around

The events is where it gets tricky, lots of callbacks
PB
	init
	handleFiles
	loadDocument

PB.UI
	utility UI routines
		notice
		error
		ajaxMessageReporting
	navigationTabs
	resizing of widgets
	
PB.UI.Phototab
	accepts drags
	slider
	image list addition/removal
	
PB.LoadImageQueue
	loads image in a queue
	
PB.fn.Image
	Image class
	
PB.ImageList - real model
	
Things I dislike: 
init chains
scattered model
image dropping:
	- drop adds files to image list
	- image list broadcasts image-added event
	- phototab listens to image-added
	- it asks pbimage to get the canvas with cb1
	- pbimage places request on image-loading queue cb2
	- queue executes cb2 sometime later
	- cb2 creates the small image, calls cb1
	- cb1 modifies the UI
	
what would ideal api look like
imageAdded() {
	canvas = image.toCanvas().then()
}
toCanvas() {
	queue.push().then().fail()
	
}

queue should be a jquery extension, or something.

Models:
PB.Model.Book
	images: array(BookImage)
	pages: array(BookPage)
	
When user drags images before the document is created, merge with existing images.
