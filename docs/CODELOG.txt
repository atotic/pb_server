Take a look at SVG http://people.mozilla.com/~vladimir/demos/photos.svg
svg converts straight to PDF :)

Nelson discovered SVG around the same time.

Refactored. Models are separated out:
Timer - util
EventListener - mixin 
Book 
BookImage
Deferred pattern makes code more understandeable
Antsy to get started on page layout, but refactored code makes me happy

Good place to get things designed:
https://www.crowdspring.com/post-a-project/, referred from Michael LaGuardia
Interesting SVG vector graphics library:

Did a bit of a code review. My js is too messy, I'd like to refactor. Deffered jQuery
pattern holds promise.
Saw backbone.js. http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#faq
They've implemented lots of stuff I've thought about, and more. Feels like like
too much to take on right now.

I like working with Sinatra. I got comfortable with the debugger, datamapper, It makes me learn interesting things. The docs are incomplete, of course. Some surprises:
- Sinatra configuration :set creates a method on the app. I expected a get/set attr API

Moved from top-level app to modular API. I do not like indeterminate namespaces.
Starterd working the forms, return values, etc. I think it'll be easier than rails.

Trying out Sinatra. Pete Warden's "Social Hello World" talked me into this.

Mar 14
Thinking about moving to Sinatra. Rails documentation sucks in several major ways 

1) All functions take a grab-bag of options
2) Documentation is a large linear dump of all method calls. There are 6 methods named render, one of which is relevant.
3) The framework makes easy things easy, and hard things a guessing game. How do I use nested forms if one of the arguments is not an ActiveRecord? I hate coding via trial and error
4) Learning Rails feels like learning one damn thing after another, I never get to see the big picture.

With Sinatra, the hope is that the learning curve will taper off.

Deployment: Pete Warden uses heroku, I can start with it. Heroku runs on Amazon. 
I think that figuring out deployment will take me a month.
Heroku will store data in S3 temporarily

Diving back into Rails.
photo_book_controller::create
Tricky problem of using a single form to edit two models: photo book + template
I wanted rails form helpers (error handling, saving of form data between pages for free)
For two models in a single form you want nested forms. 
Template needed to be a photobook nested attribute.
As PhotoBookTemplates are not ActiveRecords, or inside db, my template fakes being an ActiveRecord. 
The fakery happened through several simple routines.

Clean up the uglyness
What does photobook looks like as json?

Creating rails framework for books
Back to rails!
field_error_proc removal was a surprise.

Thinking about dropping those images, what a page looks like

Mar 2, 3
implemented image slider, looks great

- debugging memory issues. When loading 80 images, Firefox usage would grow very large
and the whole computer acted sluggish.
I investigated by loading 2000x5000 simple PNG images. PNGs were being cleverly compressed.
An image can be up to 40MB uncompressed (2000x3008x4). Firefox clears its in-memory image
cache after 10 seconds. Average image takes 1/3s/load.
That means after 10s, we have 40x30, or 1.5Gb in memory, causing machine to slow down.

Implementing tabs

Feb 21
Implemented simple qt html2pdf renderer
seems to render the entire image re-encoded as jpg
for final product, might have to hack qt.
src/painting/qprinter.cpp creates a QPdfEngine
will need specialized QPdfEngine that would encode images in original form
see qprintengine_pdf.cpp::drawImage, it reencodes it from Pixmap. Might run into trouble with effects,
text on top, etc.

wkhtmltopdf bugs:
increasing DPI to 300 rotates the image on a sample photo
decreasing dpi in reference image does not reduce the dpi
for photo books, we'd need strict control over dpi/colors
need to understand what qt is doing:
