Document storage
Book
	- images
	- roughs
	- html pages

Maintenance of book data structure in sql is complex.
Could it be simpler to store the entire book as json?
Differences between structs would be json diffs.
Same diff can be equally applied on client and server.

JsonPath : xpath for json

Book is json:
{
	id:
	title:
	images: [
	]
	pages: [
	]
	rough: [
	]
}

Usage cases:
- page added
- page deleted
- page moved
- title changed


SEQUEL/MARIADB installation

Sequel model attributes are documented in migration files

Switching to sequel from datamapper
http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/sequel/

Switched to mariadb (mysql)

mariadb on the Mac:
brew install mariadb
How do I create a database?
# Stop the daemnon
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mariadb.plist 
# blow away all the databases
rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql
# Start daemon 
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mariadb.plist
#install  database
mysql_install_db
# secure the installation, run after starting daemon
mysql_secure_installation
# create the databases
mysql -u root -p < config/setup.sql
# datamapper migrations
rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=test
rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=development
rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=production

gem install sequel
# installing the gem:
sudo gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri mysql2 -- --with-mysql-dir=$(brew --prefix mariadb) --with-mysql-config=$(brew --prefix mariadb)/bin/mysql_config
