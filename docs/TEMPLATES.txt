# TODO
How do I start?
Start with bare minimum:
minimal book starndards,
minimal book templates
Have a simple create a book experience

# User experience

book starts off from "standards collection"
standards is a curated collection of book templates, starting point for all the books.

user also collects "inspiration collection". Inspirations are pages they like.

# Technical

## Template kinds ##

### Theme ###
Collection of related book templates

### Book template ###
Book of a certain size
data:
	layouts
	backgrounds
	gadgets
	auto-layout prototype
	page size
	icon
	fonts?

inherits from master template
can be converted to other templates

### Layout template
data:
	kind (page, cover, back-cover, flap)
	span 1 or 2 or 3?
	background:
		- background can be layout template specific
		- there can be a set of backgrounds specific to this layout
	images
		- images can be droppable, belong to a layer
	text
		- every image needs a possible caption (or hidden caption)
		- big text
	master parent: what layout does this one derive from
	image count

braindump:
- can have multiple layers, some with other built-in images

# Technical issues #

Inspirational pages are frozen, cannot be edited once someone uses them
Inspirational pages are public access
Layouts that span multiple pages

# Implementation #

Standards collection
Basic
Travel
Family
Wedding

All derive from the master suite. All other styles inherit from standards. This allows us to switch between book templates.

# Data structures #

Templates can belong to users, and system.
What is my template:

Book:
 layouts: [layout-id]
 backgrounds: [background-id]
 gadgets: [gadget-id]
 pageSize:
 icon:

Layout:
 author:
 kind:
 parent:
 layers: [
 	background:

 ]

It would be convenient if layout ids were meaningful, more like urls
layout id: layout-<username>-15x6-

how do we store these:
/template/book/<user-id>/
/template/layout/<user-id>/
/template/gadget/<user-id>/
/template/assets/<user-id>/
