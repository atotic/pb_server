TEMPLATES.txt

May 2013 thinking

I can faintly see the outline of what templates will look like.
The major goals: multi-sizing, remixing, html native are there.

My programatic templates do not look very pretty, and are hard to make.
I will need to collaborate with a designer on a template foundation.
Missing pieces:
- frames are weak: no round frames, no frames partially covering the photos, no sample svg programatic frames. CSS guru needed.
- text: text styles are a rathole: font|size|bolditalic|colorback|colorfwd. Maybe not?

OLD STUFF

# TODO
How do I start?
Start with bare minimum:
minimal book starndards,
minimal book templates
Have a simple create a book experience

# User experience

book starts off from "standards collection"
standards is a curated collection of book templates, starting point for all the books.

user also collects "inspiration collection". Inspirations are pages they like.

# Technical

## Template kinds ##

### Theme ###
Collection of related book templates

### Book template ###
Book of a certain size
data:
	layouts
	backgrounds
	gadgets
	auto-layout prototype
	page size
	icon
	fonts?

inherits from master template
can be converted to other templates

### Layout template
data:
	kind (page, cover, back-cover, flap)
	span 1 or 2 or 3?
	background:
		- background can be layout template specific
		- there can be a set of backgrounds specific to this layout
	images
		- images can be droppable, belong to a layer
	text
		- every image needs a possible caption (or hidden caption)
		- big text
	master parent: what layout does this one derive from
	image count

braindump:
- can have multiple layers, some with other built-in images

# Technical issues #

Inspirational pages are frozen, cannot be edited once someone uses them
Inspirational pages are public access
Layouts that span multiple pages
