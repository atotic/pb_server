walmart & walgreens both use snapfish photo book creation software.

What I'd like:
the image workflow is a mess for an average guy

"I went to SmugMug and tried their option to create a book ONLINE (with Blub's Bookify).
However, I seem to have some issues with it.

So,

1. Does anyone else know who we can do this efficiently?
I thought it would be good if everyone created one page for their child and added it to the book online (in theory).
And if someone needed help, others could help.

However, I encountered some glitches with Blurb's Bookify.
The other options don't seem to be ONLINE.
In other words, the book would be saved to someone's personal computer - which would make it hard for everyone to do their own page.
