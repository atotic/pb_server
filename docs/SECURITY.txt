SECURITY.txt
for xss testing, use string ><img src=x onerror=prompt(1);> username

Rack::Protection has been disabled in Sveg. It was causing errors in nginx deployment.

Will need XSS security review once I do it.

Make sure all our out-strings are escaped
Check referer, nothing gets through without it

AUTHENTICATION

We use Omniauth to support different providers.

Each external login corresponds to OmniauthToken
Each token points to a user
Multiple tokens can point to the same user, so user can have multiple accounts

In the future, we'll allow users to access different services through different logins.
